## About our projects
> How do we work? We find project ideas (crazy/hackathon ideas), plan & design, gain knowledge to build, and develop & test & release apps.
> We build console/CLI apps, web apps (frontend/backend), telegram bots, and desktop/mobile apps.

## What kind of projects?
1. Interesting to build for ourselves. Can be used by us.
